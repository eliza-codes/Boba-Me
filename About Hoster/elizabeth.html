    <h1>About Elizabeth</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth and I am the person behind this entire website. I hope you enjoy clicking around. I
        personally made this website because I noticed that the majority of my friends enjoy drinking boba, I do too!
        Although, I think my friends drink this beverage quite often. So I decided to make an informational site about
        boba. I made this website during the summer of 2019 while in Mission Bit. I found out about this program through
        a close friend of mine. I was able to practice my HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

    <p>I am currently a high school student expecting to graduate in the year 2022. During my time in middle school and
        my first year of high school, I was developing and practicing my leadership skills in OMI. During my free time,
        I would either attend classes hosted by Girls Who Code or volunteering at my local library.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of my hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawing celebrities/people/characters</li>
        <li>Design clothes or furniture (sometimes)</li>
        <li>Making movies or short films (occasionally)</li>
        <li>Writing start-up lyrics to a song I came up with while hummming</li>
        <li>Reading books</li>
    </ul>
